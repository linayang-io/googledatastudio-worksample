# Data Visualization Using Google Data Studio
Using a data set sourced from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/silicon-valley-diversity-data), I built a dashboard using Google Data Studio to show the employee breakdown by race and gender of 23 tech companies in Silicon Valley during 2016. This visualization allows users to see patterns in the workplace of these tech companies and where each of these tech companies rank in regards to representation in the workplace. Project date: July 2020.

# Workplace Diversity in Tech
Diversity in the workplace is a vital part of any company. Race and gender are two of the most salient aspects of workplace diversity, and workplace diversity is an important issue across many industries, especially in the tech sector. While this data is at least four years old, this dashboard reveals some interesting patterns, and it is clear to see that some companies have better diversity representation than others.

# Insights and Conclusion
22 of the 23 tech companies in this data set had disparities between the number of male and female employees at these companies; all of which, favored the hiring of male employees over women. While Apple, Intel, Google, and Cisco are among the companies with the most employees, they had the largest gender disparities in their workforce. In regards to racial diversity, staff that identified as Asian accounted for the majority of BIPOC representation within these companies. And, only 3 companies of the 23 tech companies had half or more of their employees identify as BIPOC.
